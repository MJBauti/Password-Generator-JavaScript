# Password-Generator-JavaScript

## Description

- To better understand JavaScript, specifically functions within JavaScript, I designed a Random Password generator utilizing provided HTML & CSS. 
- The random Password Generator is a practical tool to create password fitting multiple criteria.
- 
- Additionally, I increased my knowledge in Character Set Code. Which I utilized in my random character selector functions.

## Usage

![The Password Generator application displays a red button to "Generate Password".](./assets/Images/screenshot.png)

To use the Password Generator: 

- Click the red 'Generate Password' button
- Select Password Length
- Confirm Character choices

The webpage will do the rest for you. After creation teh password is selectable within the prompt.

## Credits

Help with the random character generator came from TraversyMedia on YouTube.
